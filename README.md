# Learn .NET from the docs
This repo is solely for training and practicing. I Use this repo to save and keep track of the learnings as I go over dotnet documentations on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/)

This branch (main) is merely an landing page. All exercises will be made and commited to different branches according to the tasks and topics.

If you are checking this out, thank you.
